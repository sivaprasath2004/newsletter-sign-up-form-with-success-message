   ## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates the development of single-page applications (SPAs).

- **HTML**: HyperText Markup Language is used to create the structure of the web pages in the React application.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the components and layout of the React application, enhancing its visual appeal and user experience.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: JavaScript is the programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to the React components. ES6+ features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and classes are commonly used in React development.

- **npm or Yarn**: Package managers like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn are used to manage project dependencies, install libraries, and run scripts for building and deploying the React application.

- **Webpack or Create React App**: Bundlers like Webpack or scaffolding tools like Create React App are commonly used in React projects to automate build processes, bundle assets, and provide development servers.

- **Babel**: Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to use the latest ECMAScript features in their React codebase by transpiling it into browser-compatible JavaScript.
  
- **React Router (Optional)**: React Router is a library for adding client-side routing to React applications, enabling navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application.
